## Hello, I'm Irtaza Fiaz 👋

<p>I am a programmer, specialising in the mobile development arena. Since the last year, I have been developing different mobile applications.

I’m currently employed as a software engineer at i2c. I’m hands on in all stages of the programming cycle, from planning and design to testing and deployment. No two days are the same for me; my tasks may involve analysing algorithms, altering code, fixing bugs, brainstorming ideas or integrating new systems.

Something that I love about programming is the opportunity to work with people from a wide range of disciplines. The software development lifecycle involves working with so many different people and departments and, as a people person and someone who loves to build new relationships, it’s great to be able to come together with other professionals who are striving towards the same goal.

If you want to talk about programming, coding, software engineering, or anything else, drop me a line.
